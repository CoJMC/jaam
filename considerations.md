MISC
CKEDITOR
- consider changing django-ckeditor to https://github.com/dwaiter/django-ckeditor
- dwaiter's version allows for staticfiles processing and initial config should be easier
- - although there's still some nonsense about media and symlinking

- things with Backbone will break on legacy severs (ones that do not support PUT/DELETE, potentially others)

ROY:
- underscore
- whatever the one was for dependence binding
- zepto
- mustache? whatever the js template is, I'd prefer to avoid the jquery-tpl lib

CONCERNS:
- userprofile/journalist - discuss this with Matt
-
