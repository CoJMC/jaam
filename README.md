JaaM (GlobalEyeWitness)
=======================

Journalism as a Means
http://www.unlglobaleyewitness.org

Jaam is the code-named software that powers UNL Global Eyewitness. This was created via the combined efforts of the UNL College of Journalism (faculty and students) along with a Raikes School Design Studio team.

This Django project has the following features:

* stores photos in a Boto-compatible backend (S3, Rackfiles, etc).

* thumbnails via easy_thumbnails

* social login (currently configured for Facebook, Twitter, Google OpenID, OpenID) via django-socialauth

* partially implemented REST service via tastypie

(This readme could still use more attention but I'm too biased to know what is relevant to put here.)
