/*
 * less has inconsistent selector inheritence (nested inherits in mixins, regular doesn't [and can't seem to be manually mixed in [ex/ :hover]])
 * scss has no control over scoping, which is annoying, but probably the less of two evils
 *  scss's default choice in regards to scope means that order matters
 *  refactoring scss could cause problems and change the rendering of a page
